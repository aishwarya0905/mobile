cloud computing:
     1.the remote server that we accesss through internet for deploying our own resources 
     2.access through the remote location via internet
     
#traditional way---------
main things are important through hosting website
-----------------------------------------------------
-infrastructure
-server rooms
-networking
-electricity
-cooling system
-human resource
-capital
-maintenance

In cloud these all things are provided by cloud or owned by cloud

#essential characteristics of cloud computing:
-on demand self service
if you want increase the server so you can pay the rent for that and use it

-broad network access and high availability
globally accsess,availability of resorces

-resourse pooling
resource sharing and accessible to users

-rapid elasticity
rapidly create resource and also destroy according your requirement

-measure services
we measure the cloud services

#deployment model
1.public cloud
publically accessible to all through internet
 
2.private cloud
set up for particular organization connected through private network

3.hybrid cloud
public+private ex. aws

4.community cloud
made for community

#service models
layers of service models=
       application        
       data             
       runtime
       middleware
       os
       virtualization
       server
       storage
       network

IAAS(infrastructure as a service) virtualization,servers,storage,network provided by cloud vender and other things managed by client.provide infrastructre
ex.

PAAS(platform as a service) runtime,middleware,os,vitualization,servers,storage,network managed by cloud vender and other things manged by client
ex.

SAAS(software as a service)
all things are managed by cloud vender
ex. google drive

#aws global infrastructure
31 regions and 99+ availabilty zone
regions are geographical stations 


#IAM Service
resources
1.users: who will use account
2.groups:adding user0
3.policies: aws resourse from service iam that can be used to assignpermission to any identity
4.roles:communication between 2 services
features of the roles:
1.better way to provide access
2.temprory access
3.less human interaction
4.machine permission

1.service which is accessing
2.service which is accessible(permission)
3.role name

polies attached to user ,groups and roles
roles attached to aws resource only to permit permission to other service

ARN filed=uniq identity
1.ARN
2.partition=aws,aws china,aws government
3.service name
4.region
5.account id
6.resource type
7.resource name

active directory= centralized user server/user server setup

#s3 service =simple storage service
object storage,highly scalable/available
any amount of data-access from anywhere
unlimited data storage
99.999999999999 =3 geolocation replica

types=1.object storage(data+metadata)
      2.block storage(data/block)

global service
bucket(resource of s3)= container
buckets are region specific
100 buckets create on each region
bucket name = world wide unique

static website= no database,nonchangable
dynamic website=stored database,changable

CDN =content delivery network
transfer acceleration depends on
1.internet speed
2.server speed
3.distance
4.processing power


storage classes:
frequently acess
    standard 
    reduced redundancy
intelligent tiering
infrequently acess
    standard-IA
    onezone-IA
archive
    glacier
    deep glacier
